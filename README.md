Ergosimo (work in progress)
===========================

This application aims to make life a little bit easier for people working in Greece, who receive social security through the mechanism called "Ergosimo".

Each Ergosimo accounts for a certain amount of insurance days, the total amount of which determines things like:

*   When someone is eligible for a pension
*   If so, how much pension

Unfortunately, calculating the amount of insurance days is not straightforward. It is fully described in the [Circular 43/11-Jul-2013](http://www.ika.gr/gr/infopages/memos/EG_43_2013.pdf). This application aims to make it easier for people to see how much insurance days their Ergosima account for. I cannot guarantee that it is correct, or that it will be udpated when the legislation is.

The application is hosted at [Heroku](https://ergosimo.herokuapp.com/)
